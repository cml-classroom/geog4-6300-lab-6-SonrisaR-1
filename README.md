# Geog4/6300: Lab 6

Complete the lab assignment by filling in the template. Knit it to a Github document and then push it up to the Github repo for this assignment. When you're ready to submit, go to the "issues" tab and create a new issue. Use the subject line "Lab 6 complete" and then put "@jshannon75" and your name in the body, along with any other comments you want to share about the assignment. Your grade will be entered below:

* Question 1: Good<p>
* Question 2: This works! Legends are hard with `tmap_arrange`<p>
* Question 3: A little short. Are other variables also associated spatially with NDVI?<p>
* Question 4: This covers the basics. Next step would be including the unit of analysis (rainfall in mm, temp in C, etc.), which would make these coefficients more meaningful.<p>
* Question 5: Good<p>
* Question 6: Again, you might say more about how important any change in coefficients seems--does it change the story of the model at all?<p>
* Question 7: Good<p>
* Question 8: Good<p>
* Question 9: This works!<p>

* Challenge: You've got most of this. The interpretation needs to do more to interpret the model results.<p>
<p>
General feedback: Marked as complete, but you would need to revise the challenge.
